define('info_p3', 'The concert is filmed in real time, then broadcasted either live on television channels, or with the concept of «Pepper Ghost», in French «Fantôme de Pepper». To implement this concept, a video projector must be installed on a stand at the top of the stage. It projects the video live (or not) on a mirror, placed just in front of the lens, and tilted towards the ground. On the ground, between the stage and the audience, but hidden from view, is another mirror. It receives the image of the first mirror and sends it back, this time on a large plexiglass, tilted, fixed to the edge of the stage up to the bar supporting the projector. This  projection  of  the  image  on  the  inclined  plane  of  the  plexiglass  makes  the  spectator perceive the stage (here the concert) as if he were happening in front of him. To better understand the concept, here is an explanatory video.
